A note on GD & FreeType Library support.

You must compile these options into your PHP at the time of install. 
If you did not enable it when you installed your PHP, you must re-install PHP to enable it.

To tell if you have GD/FreeType enabled:

Open the included info/captcha/test.php and uncomment the code block. Save the changes.
Open your browser and type the direct link to "info/captcha/test.php", ex: http://www.mysite.com/info/captcha/test.php

You should see a page showing you your PHP configuration.
Scroll down and look for the gd section to see if they are enabled.

**************************************** Recomment the code block in info/captcha/test.php ****************************************
(This is for your security. A blank php file displays a blank page, preventing unwanted users knowing your php configuration)
